# [Brave Goggle](https://search.brave.com/help/goggles) from a list of [Hackernews Personal Blogs](https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs)

The [original list](https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/blob/master/list.opml) was given in `.opml` format.

For my purposes I converted it into a `.json` using a python script (`test.ipynb`). Total of 1229 entries.

Here are the [Docs](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/blob/main/getting-started.md#goggles-syntax) for making Goggles (custom search result configuration) for the [Brave search engine](https://search.brave.com/)

The things I created here are under MIT License just like the original [Hackernews Personal Blogs List](https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs).

## Problems 
Some of these blogs are of questionable quality in my opinion. Since it is all RSS, and some blogs are using some kind of link shortners, the best I can do is cutting off the last part of the URl.

My scraping skills are not good enough to automate figuring out reversing RSS links into normal website links.
